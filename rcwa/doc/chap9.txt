  [1X9.1 [33X[0;0YRequirements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis   version   of   [5XRCWA[105X   needs  at  least  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.8.1,  [5XResClasses[105XÂ 4.0.0,
  [5XGRAPE[105XÂ 4.3Â [Soi06],   [5XPolycyclic[105XÂ 2.6Â [EN09]   and   [5XGAPDoc[105XÂ 1.4Â [LN11].   With
  possible  exception  of  the  most  recent version of [5XResClasses[105X, all needed
  packages are already present in an up-to-date standard [5XGAP[105X installation. The
  [5XRCWA[105X  package can be used on all platforms for which [5XGAP[105X is available. It is
  completely  written in the [5XGAP[105X language and does neither contain nor require
  external  binaries.  In  particular,  possible  warnings  concerning missing
  binaries issued by other packages when loading [5XRCWA[105X can safely be ignored.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.2 [33X[0;0YInstallation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLike  any  other [5XGAP[105X package, [5XRCWA[105X must be installed in the [11Xpkg[111X subdirectory
  of the [5XGAP[105X distribution. This is accomplished by extracting the distribution
  file  in  this directory. If you have done this, you can load the package as
  usual via [10XLoadPackage( "rcwa" );[110X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  following  routine is a development tool. As all files it generates are
  included in the distribution file anyway, users will not need it.[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ynothing.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  function  builds  the  manual  of the [5XRCWA[105X package in the file formats
  LaTeX,  PDF,  HTML  and  ASCII  text.  This is accomplished using the [5XGAPDoc[105X
  package  by Frank LÃ¼beck and Max NeunhÃ¶ffer. Building the manual is possible
  only on UNIX systems and requires PDFLaTeX.[133X

  [33X[0;0YPerforms  a  nontrivial computation to check whether an installation of [5XRCWA[105X
  appears to work. Errors, i.e. differences to the correct results of the test
  computation,     are     reported.    The    processed    test    file    is

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ynothing.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YRuns  the  full  test  suite  of  the  [5XRCWA[105X  package. Any differences to the
  supposed  results  of the test computations are reported. The processed test
  file is [11Xpkg/rcwa/tst/testall.g[111X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPlease  note  that  the  test  suite is a tool for developing. The tests are
  deliberately  very  volatile  to allow to spot possible problems of any kind
  also  in  other  packages or in the [5XGAP[105X Library. For this reason you may see
  reports  of  differences  which  simply  reflect  improved  methods in other
  packages  or in the [5XGAP[105X Library (for example an object may already know more
  of  its attributes or properties than it is expected to, or an object may be
  represented  in  a  better  way),  or which are caused by changes of the way
  certain  objects  are  printed, and which are therefore harmless. However if
  the  correct  and  the actual output look different mathematically or if you
  see  error  messages  or  if  [5XGAP[105X  crashes, then something went wrong. Also,
  reports  about  significantly  increased run times of individual commands as
  well  as  run  times  of test files which are much longer than the predicted
  times shown may indicate a problem.[133X

  the  [5XGAP[105X  Reference  Manual  for  a  description  of the Info mechanism. For
  convenience: [10XRCWAInfo([110X[3Xn[103X[10X)[110X is a shorthand for [10XSetInfoLevel(InfoRCWA[110X,[3Xn[103X[10X)[110X.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.6 [33X[0;0YUtility functions for bitmap pictures[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XRCWA[105X  provides  functions to create bitmap picture files from suitable pixel
  matrices  and  vice  versa.  The author has successfully tested this feature
  both  under  Linux  and  under  Windows,  and  the  produced pictures can be
  processed further with many common graphics programs:[133X

  [33X[0;0YWrites  the  pixel  matrix  [3Xpicture[103X  to  a bitmap- (bmp-) picture file named
  [3Xfilename[103X.  The  filename  should  include  the entire pathname. The argument
  [3Xpicture[103X  can  be  a GF(2) matrix, in which case a monochrome picture file is
  generated.  In  this  case,  zeros stand for black pixels and ones stand for
  white  pixels.  The argument [3Xpicture[103X can also be an integer matrix, in which
  case  a  24-bit  True  Color  picture  file  is generated. In this case, the
  entries  of  the  matrix are supposed to be integers [22Xn = 65536 â‹… red + 256 â‹…

  [33X[0;0Y[5XRCWA[105X provides a routine to convert [5XGAP[105X logfiles to HTML.[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ynothing.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis function converts the [5XGAP[105X logfile [3Xlogfilename[103X to HTML. The extension of
  the input file must be [10X*.log[110X. The name of the output file is the same as the
  one of the input file except that the extension [10X*.log[110X is replaced by [10X*.html[110X.

  [1X9.8 [33X[0;0YSome general utility functions[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XRCWA[105X  provides  a  couple  of small utility functions which can be used in a
  more general context. They are described in this section.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe    utility    functions    for    groups    and   group   elements   are
  [10XGeneratorsAndInverses([3XG[103X[10X)[110X  which  returns a list of generators of [3XG[103X and their
  inverses, the function [10XEpimorphismByGenerators([3XG[103X[10X,[3XH[103X[10X)[110X which is a shorthand for
  [10XGroupHomomorphismByImages([3XG[103X[10X,[3XH[103X[10X,    GeneratorsOfGroup([3XG[103X[10X),GeneratorsOfGroup([3XH[103X[10X))[110X
  (there  is also an [10XNC[110X version of this), and the function [10XListOfPowers([3Xg[103X[10X,[3Xexp[103X[10X)[110X
  which returns the list [10X[[3Xg[103X[10X,[3Xg[103X[10X^2,...,[3Xg[103X[10X^[3Xexp[103X[10X][110X of powers ofÂ [3Xg[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  methods [10XEquivalenceClasses([3Xl[103X[10X,[3Xinv[103X[10X)[110X and [10XEquivalenceClasses([3Xl[103X[10X,[3Xrel[103X[10X)[110X,
  which  decompose  a  listÂ [3Xl[103X  into  equivalence  classes under an equivalence
  relation.  The  equivalence  relation  is  given  either  as  a function [3Xinv[103X
  computing a class invariant of a given list entry or as a function [3Xrel[103X which
  takes  as  arguments  two  list  entries  and  returns  either [10Xtrue[110X or [10Xfalse[110X
  depending  on  whether the arguments belong to the same equivalence class or
  not.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  is  a  function [10XGraphClasses([3Xn[103X[10X)[110X, which computes a list of isomorphism
  classes  of  graphs with vertices [22X1, 2, dots, n[122X, and a function [10XAllGraphs([3Xn[103X[10X)[110X
  which  computes  a  list of representatives of these classes. The graphs are
  represented as lists of edges, where each edge is a list of the two vertices
  it connects, and they are ordered by ascending number of edges. The function
  [10XIdGraph([3Xgraph[103X[10X,[3Xclasses[103X[10X)[110X returns the index [10Xi[110X such that [3Xgraph[103X lies [3Xclasses[103X[10X[i][110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YYet another utility function is [10XAssignGlobals([3Xrec[103X[10X)[110X which takes as argument a
  record  [3Xrec[103X and assigns its components to global variables of the same (i.e.
  the component's) names.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function  [10XNextProbablyPrimeInt([3Xn[103X[10X)[110X  returns the smallest integer passing
  [10XIsProbablyPrimeInt[110X  larger  than  [3Xn[103X.  The  function  [10XPrimeNumbersIterator( )[110X
  returns an iterator which runs over the prime numbers in ascending order; it
  takes  an  optional  argument  [3Xchunksize[103X  which  specifies the length of the
  interval  which is sieved in one go (the default is 10000000), and which can
  be  used  to  balance  runtime  vs.  memory  consumption. It is assumed that
  [3Xchunksize[103X  is  larger than any gap between two consecutive primes within the
  range    one    intends   to   run   the   iterator   over.   The   function
  [10XAllSmoothIntegers([3Xmaxp[103X[10X,[3Xmaxn[103X[10X)[110X  returns  a  list  of all integers less than or
  equal  to [3Xmaxn[103X which do not have prime divisors exceeding [3Xmaxp[103X, the function
  [10XExponentOfPrime([3Xn[103X[10X,[3Xp[103X[10X)[110X  returns  the  exponent  of  the  prime  [3Xp[103X in the prime
  factorization  of  [3Xn[103X,  and the function [10XLaTeXStringFactorsInt([3Xn[103X[10X)[110X returns the
  prime factorization of an integer [3Xn[103X as a string in LaTeX format.[133X
