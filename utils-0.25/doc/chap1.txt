  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XUtils[105X  package provides a space for utility functions from a variety of
  [5XGAP[105X  packages to be collected together into a single package. In this way it
  is  hoped  that  they will become more visible to other package authors. Any
  package  author  who  transfers a function to [5XUtils[105X will become an author of
  [5XUtils[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  function  (or  collection  of  functions) is suitable for transfer from a
  package [5XHome[105X to [5XUtils[105X if the following conditions are satisfied.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function does not depend on the remaining functions in [5XHome[105X[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  function  does not do what can already be done with a [5XGAP[105X library
        function.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDocumentation of the function and test examples are available.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  function  is sufficiently non-specialised so that it might ber of
        use to other authors.[133X

  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YThe current transfer procedure[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  consider  here  the  process  for transferring utility functions from an
  existing package (the [5XHome[105X package, say) to [5XUtils[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  the functions in [5XHome[105X all have names of the form [10XHOME_FunctionName[110X then,
  in  [5XUtils[105X,  these  functions  are  likely  to  be renamed as [10XFunctionName[110X or
  something  similar.  In this case the problem of duplicate declarations does
  not  arise.  This  is  what  has  happened  with  transfers from the [5XAutoDoc[105X
  package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  case  where  the  function  names  are  unchanged  is more complicated.
  Initially  we  tried  out  a process which allowed repeated declarations and
  installations of the functions being transferred. This involved additions to
  the  main  library  files  [11Xglobal.g[111X  and [11Xoper.g[111X. Since there were misgivings
  about  interfering  in this way with basic operations such as [10XBIND_GLOBAL[110X, a
  simpler (but slightly less convenient) process has been adopted.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsing an alternative procedure, the following steps are proposed when making
  transfers from [5XHome[105X to [5XUtils[105X.[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6Y([5XHome[105X:)  Offer  functions  for  inclusion.  This may be simply done by
        emailing  a  list  of functions. More usefully, email the declaration,
        implementation,  test and documentation files, e.g.: [11Xhome.gd[111X, [11Xhome.gi[111X,
        [11Xhome.tst[111X and [11Xhome.xml[111X,[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6Y([5XHome[105X:)  Declare that [12Xm.n[112X is the last version of [5XHome[105X to contain these
        functions.[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6Y([5XUtils[105X:) Add strings [3X"home"[103X and [3X"m.n"[103X to the list [10XUtilsPackageVersions[110X

        this stage, [13Xthe copied code will not be read[113X.[133X
  
  [31X5[131X   [33X[0;6Y([5XUtils[105X:)  Add  the  test and documentation material to the appropriate
        files.  The  copied code can be tested by temporarily moving [5XHome[105X away
        from [5XGAP[105X's package directory.[133X

        transferred functions. Edit or remove references to them in the manual
        and tests, and add a note to the manual that these functions have been
        transferred.  Add  [5XUtils[105X  to  the  list of [5XHome[105X's required packages in
        [11XPackageInfo.g[111X. Release a new version of [5XHome[105X.[133X
  
  [31X8[131X   [33X[0;6Y([5XUtils[105X:)  In  due  course,  when  the  new version(s) of [5XHome[105X are well
        established,  it  may  be  possible  to remove the conditional clauses
        mentioned in item 4 above.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  note  on running the tests. As long as a function being transferred still
  exists  in  the [5XHome[105X package, the code will not be read from [5XUtils[105X. So, when
  the  tests  are  run,  it  is necessary to [10XLoadPackage( "home" );[110X before the
  function  is  called.  The  file [11Xtestall.g[111X makes sure that all the necessary
  packages are loaded before the individual tests are called.[133X
