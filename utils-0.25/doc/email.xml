  <Func Name="DownloadFile" Arg="url"/>
  <Returns>
    the contents of the file with URL <A>url</A> in the form of a string
    if that file exists and the download was successful, and <C>fail</C>
    otherwise.
  </Returns>
  <Description>
    This function needs the <Package>IO</Package> package, and
    as most system-related functions it works only under UNIX.
    Also the computer must of course be connected to the Internet.

<ManSection>
  <Func Name="SendEmail" Arg="sendto, copyto, subject, text"/>
  <Returns>
    zero if everything worked correctly, and a system error number otherwise.
  </Returns>
  <Description>
    Sends an e-mail with subject <A>subject</A> and body <A>text</A> to the
    addresses in the list <A>sendto</A>, and copies it to those in the list
    <A>copyto</A>. The first two arguments must be lists of strings, and
    the latter two must be strings. <P/>

    As most system-related functions, <C>SendEmail</C> works only under UNIX.
    Also the computer must of course be connected to the Internet.

<ManSection>
  <Func Name="EmailLogFile" Arg="addresses"/>
  <Returns>
    zero if everything worked correctly, and a system error number otherwise.
  </Returns>
  <Description>
    Sends the current log file by e-mail to <A>addresses</A>, if &GAP; is in
    logging mode and one is working under UNIX, and does nothing otherwise.
    The argument <A>addresses</A> must be either a list of e-mail addresses
    or a single e-mail address. Long log files are abbreviated, i.e. if the
    log file is larger than 64KB, then any output is truncated at 1KB, and
    if the log file is still longer than 64KB afterwards, it is truncated
    at&nbsp;64KB.
