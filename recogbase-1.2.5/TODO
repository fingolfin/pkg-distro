Future: 

Think whether the changing of gensN after creation might hurt other
places than LowerLeftPGroup.

SLPforElement methods without evaluation --> like in SiftAsWord ???

IsMember for (ri,x) recursively
Make things into functions???

========================================================================

to talk ???:

  Convention: SLPforElement guarantees that a returned slp does the job
    ==> \in is easier, does not have to evaluate the slp
    ==> in StabChain code we divide up labels
    ==> in Hom code we divide up preimage of the image, go to kernel
    ==> doable everywhere (in fact done everywhere)

  FindKernelFastNormalClosure always?
