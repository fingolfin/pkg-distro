  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YGeneral aims[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  overall  aim of [5XQPA[105X is to provide computational tools in basic research
  in  mathematics  (algebra). It seeks to furnish users within and outside the
  area  of  representation  theory  of  finite  dimensional  algebras  with  a
  computational  software  package  that  will help in exploring a problem and
  testing  conjectures.  As  with  all  software  development,  new  ideas and
  question  will arise. The ability to study and compute examples will help in
  proving  or  disproving well-established questions/conjectures. Furthermore,
  it will enable us to consider new examples which were not accessible by hand
  or  other  means  before.  In  this  way,  we  hope that [5XQPA[105X will aid in the
  development,  not  only  of  the  area  of  representation  theory of finite
  dimensional  algebras,  but  also  of  a  broad  variety  of  other areas of
  mathematics,  where such structures occur. In addition we aspire to create a
  research   environment   for   international  cooperation  on  computational
  representation theory of finite dimensional algebras.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YInstallation and system requirements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XQPA[105X   does   not   use  external  binaries  and,  therefore,  works  without
  restrictions  on  the  type  of  the  operating  system. This version of the
  package  is  designed  for  GAP  >=  4.5  and no compatibility with previous
  releases  of  GAP 4 is guaranteed. However, [5XQPA[105X depend on the Groebner basis
  GAP-package [5XGBNP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  use  the  [5XQPA[105X  online  help it is necessary to install the GAP 4 package
  [5XGAPDoc[105X  by  Frank L√ºbeck and Max Neunh√∂ffer, which is available from the GAP
  site or from [7Xhttp://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XQPA[105X  is  distributed  in  standard  format (tar.gz) and can be obtained from
  [7Xhttp://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/[107X.  To  install  the package, unpack its
  archive  in  the pkg subdirectory of your GAP installation. In a similar way
  install the GAP-package [5XGBNP[105X which is available from the GAP site.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  more  detailed  installation  information  and  an  alternative way for
  downloading [5XQPA[105X see [7Xhttp://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/[107X.[133X
