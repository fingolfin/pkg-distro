 NormalizInterface supports GAP 4.8.0 or later, and Normaliz 3.0.0 or later.
 <P/>
 For technical reasons, installing and using NormalizInterface requires
 that your version of GAP is compiled in a special way. Specifically, GAP
 must be compiled against the exact same version of the GMP library as
 Normaliz. By default, GAP compiles its own version of GMP; however, we
 cannot use that, as it lacks C++ support, which is required by Normaliz.
 <P/>
 Thus as the very first step, please install a version of GMP in your
 system. On most Linux and BSD distributions, there should be a GMP
 package available with your system's package manager. On Mac OS X, you
 can install GMP via Fink, MacPorts or Homebrew.
 <P/>
 Next, make sure your GAP installation is compiled against the system
 wide GMP installation. To do so, switch to the GAP root directory, and
 enter the following commands:
 <P/>
 <Listing><![CDATA[
 make clean
 ./configure --with-gmp=system
 make
 ]]></Listing>
 Next you need to compile a recent version of Normaliz. This requires the
 presence of several further system software packages, which you install
 via your system's package manager. At least the following are required:
 <P/>
 <List>
 <Item>
 git
 </Item>
 <Item>
 cmake
 </Item>
 <Item>
 boost
 </Item>
 </List>
 Once you have installed these, you can build Normaliz by using
 the build-normaliz.sh script we provide. It takes a single,
 optional parameter: the location of the GAP root directory.
 <P/>
 <Listing><![CDATA[
 ./build-normaliz.sh GAPDIR
 ]]></Listing>
 Once it completed successfully, you can then build NormalizInterface
 like this:
 <P/>
 <Listing><![CDATA[
 ./configure --with-gaproot=GAPDIR
 make
 ]]></Listing>
 If you need to customize the normaliz compilation, please have a look at
 Normaliz.git/source/INSTALL. Remember to use the same compiler and GMP
 version as for GAP.
 <P/>
