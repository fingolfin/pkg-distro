\Chapter{Installing and loading the package}

The package can be downloaded from
    www.icm.tu-bs.de/~beick/soft/sglppow/sglppow-Version.tar

Then tar -zxvf slgppow.tar produces a directory sglppow. This should be
moved into the pkg directory of a GAP installation.

The package is set up so that after loading it into GAP with LoadPackage 
the full functionality of the package is available.
