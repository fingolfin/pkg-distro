The matgrp package provides an implementation of a method for
FittingFreeLiftSetup
for matrix groups, using the recog package. It will work for matrix groups
over finite fields, as well as over residue class rings ``Integers mod n''.
It is provided as a package, as it requires other packages (recog, and its
dependencies) to be installed.

At this point no methods for functions (such as ConjugacyClasses) exist
that automatically apply to matrix groups.
However if calling
FittingFreeLiftSetup
on a matrix group first, afterwards certain operations (such as ConjugacyClasses
and MaximalSubgroupClassReps) will apply with Solvable radical methods.

The code is still in beta test stage. It is possible that error messages
arise when computing the initial data structure. (Some of these are due to
the recog package) In such a case simply call
the command again.
