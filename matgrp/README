The matgrp package provides an implementation of a method for
FittingFreeLiftSetup
for matrix groups, using the recog package.
It is provided as a package, as it requires other packages (recog, and its
dependencies) to be installed.

At this point no methods exist that automatically apply to matrix groups.
However if calling
FittingFreeLiftSetup
on a matrix group, afterwards certain operations (such as ConjugacyClasses
and MaximalSubgroupClassReps) will apply with Solvable radical methods.

The code is still in beta test stage. It is possible that error messages
arise when computing the initial data structure. In such a case simply call
the command again.
