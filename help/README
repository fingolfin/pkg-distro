    README file for the `HeLP' GAP4 package
        



To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    HeLP-x.x.tar.gz



and unpack it using 
    gunzip HeLP-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf HeLP-x.x.tar.




(Note that if you use a browser like `netscape' for downloading the
archive file the `gunzip' step above may already be done by the browser,
although the name of your file may still have the misleading `.gz'
extension.)

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `help'.

Note that the package uses the software package 4ti2 and is hence only working
on systems which have 4ti2 installed.  (For more informations on 4ti2 and to download it, please visit
http://www.4ti2.de)  To interact with 4ti2 the package makes use of the
4ti2-Interface written by S. Gutsche which, in turn uses the package IO.  Note that the latter
package needs a C part to be complied.  See the readme-file or the documentation of that package.

This completes the installation of the package.

E-mail us if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
