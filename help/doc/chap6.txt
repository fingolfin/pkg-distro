              [33X[0;12YUsually all these packages should come with a sufficently recent
              GAP-installation (4.7.8 or newer) and should be contained in the
              pkg-folder  of  the GAP-installation. To see if they are working
              you   can  load  them  by  typing  [9XLoadPackage("[name]");[109X  after
              starting GAP, where [9X[name][109X is the name of the package.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  IO-package  needs  a  C-part  to  be compiled. To see if this has
        already  been  done  on  your system, you can enter [9XLoadPackage("IO");[109X
        after starting GAP. If the result is [9Xfail[109X and the package is contained
        in  the  pkg-folder,  than most likely the C-part is not yet compiled.
        For  information  on  installation and in particular on how to compile
        the            C-part,            see            the            manual
        ([7Xhttp://gap-system.github.io/io/doc/chap0.html[107X) (in particular Chapter
        2) or the README-file of that package.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPlease  make sure that www.4ti2.de ([7Xhttp://www.4ti2.de[107X) (Version 1.6.5
        or  newer)  is  installed. In case of an error-message "The executable
        'zsolve'  provided  by  the software 4ti2 was not found." after typing
        [9XLoadPackage("HeLP");[109X  either the software is not properly installed or
        installed  in  a directory where GAP can not find it, i.e. a directory
        not  contained  in the path-variable. The content of this variable can
        typically  be  displayed by typing [9Xecho $PATH[109X (Linux, Mac) [9Xecho %PATH%[109X
        (Windows)  in  a  terminal  or  a  command  prompt. The manual of 4ti2
        contains  several  pages of information on how to install the program.
        Note  that  the  installation  of  4ti2  requires  gcc  (g++)  and gmp
        installed  (which  come  with  many  Linux  installations  or  can  be
        installed  using  a  package  manager).  Make sure to execute all four
        commands   indicated   in   the  4ti2  manual  (possibly  without  the
        [9X--prefix=[109X-command):[133X

        [33X[0;6YDepending  on  the  settings  of  your  system  you  might  need  root
        privileges  (type  [9Xsudo[109X in front of every command) to unpack the files
        and  install  them.  To check whether the installation worked, you can
        enter  [9Xzsolve[109X in a terminal. In case one of the required programs (g++
        or  gmp)  was  not installed when running [9Xmake[109X for the first time, you
        might  need  to run [9Xmake clean[109X and the above commands several times to
        complie  4ti2  succesfully.  If  you  already have 4ti2 installed in a
        directory  not  contained  in  the  path-variable  and want to avoid a
        re-installation, in many cases the following helps:[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YStart  a  terminal  and  access  a  path written in your bash or
              system_bash. Typically [9Xusr/local/bin[109X should work.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YRun  [9Xln  -s  /[PathToZsolve] zsolve[109X, where [9X[PathToZsolve][109X is the
              path  to the executable zsolve. This sets a symlink to the right
              place.  E.g.  [9Xln  -s /opt/4ti2/bin/zsolve zsolve[109X was used on the
              (Linux) computers in Stuttgart.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWe        also        recommend        to        install        lrslib
        ([7Xhttp://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html[107X), at least version 4.3 (note
        that  version 4.2 or older sometimes produces unwanted behavior). This
        software  provides  the 'redund' command, which can be switched on and
        off  within  HeLP,  but  which often leads to better performances (cf.
        [2XHeLP_UseRedund[102X  ([14X3.5-2[114X)). For installation see the User's Guide or the
        Readme-file  on the above mentioned homepage. Usually, after unpacking
        in  a  directory contained in the path-variable it should be enough to
        call[133X
  
        [33X[0;6Y[9Xmake all[109X[133X
  
        [33X[0;6Y(possibly as root) inside the lrslib-directory.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIn  case this does not help to get HeLP running, please feel more than
        welcome to contact one of the maintainers of the package.[133X
  
  
  [1X6.2 [33X[0;0YComputations with big coefficients - precision problems[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  using  4ti2,  HeLP  calls  it  per default with a maximum precision of
  32bit.  In  case  one  gets  error  messages stating that the results of the
  calculations  were  near  the  maximum  precision, the used precision can be
  influenced  by  using  [2XHeLP_Change4ti2Precision[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X).  For groups with a
  "reasonable" order there should be no problems with the precision.[133X
  
  
  [1X6.3 [33X[0;0YHow much 4ti2 is really there?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  reason, why the program 4ti2 is used in this package, is basically that
  it  can  solve  systems of linear inequalities efficently and there exists a
  good  GAP-Interface  to  it.  However there is only one line of code where a
  function  is  called  which  accesses 4ti2. Thus the effort of using another
  solver  of inequalities would be not so big, if there is a GAP-Interface for
  it.  If  you  are  aware  of  such a solver and would like to use it in this
  package,  please  contact  the  authors of this package. We will be happy to
  help.[133X
