  [33X[0;0YThe  purpose  of  this  package  is  to provide functionalities to work with
  torsion  units  in  (integral) group rings. It implements a method which was
  developed  by  I.S. Luthar and I.B.S. Passi in [LP89] and which was extended
  by  M.  Hertweck  in  [Her07].  These  names also constitute the name of the
  method,  suggested by A. Konovalov: [13XHe[113Xrtweck-[13XL[113Xuthar-[13XP[113Xassi. The theory behind
  the method is briefly described in Chapter [14X5[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  uses  the  software  4ti2  [tea]  and is hence only working on
  systems  which  have  4ti2  installed.  For  more information on 4ti2 and to
  download it, please visit www.4ti2.de ([7Xhttp://www.4ti2.de[107X). To interact with
  4ti2  the  package  makes  use  of the 4ti2-Interface written by S. Gutsche,
  which  in  turn  uses  the  package IO. Note that the latter package needs a
  C-part  to  be  compiled;  see  the readme-file or the documentation of that
  package.  The  package  also provides the possibility to use redund form the
  lrslib  software  [Avi], to remove redundant inequalities before solving the
  system,  which might speed up the computations significantly. However, it is
  not  a  requirement  to  have  lrslib  installed.  If  the  above  mentioned
  preconditions  are  fulfilled,  one just has to copy the HeLP-package in the
  GAP   pkg-directory.   Now   the   package   can   be   loaded   by   typing
  [9XLoadPackage("HeLP");[109X  during a GAP-session. If the HeLP-package doesn't work
  properly  on  your  computer,  you  might want to check Section [14X6.1[114X for some
  trouble shooting.[133X
