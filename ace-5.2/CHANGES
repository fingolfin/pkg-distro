In this file we record the changes since the 3.xxx versions of the ACE
package. Also look at gap/CHANGES  for  a  history  of  the  pre-3.xxx
development.

#To Do in Version 5.3/5.4
#  o Fix bug that appeared with GAP 4.5, and hence at the time of ACE 5.1,
#    where the order options are put to ACE is no longer respected. The 
#    original coding of ACE exploited an undocumented feature of record 
#    fields, namely that their ordering was fixed in versions of GAP <=4.4.
#  o Convert documentation to be GAPDoc-generated.
#
Version 5.2 (2016-03-11)
   Mainly cosmetic changes to improve compatibility with GAP 4.7.
   o LICENSE (new file)
     - All parts of ACE (including the GAP package, and the original C
       standalone executable) are now licensed under the so-called MIT 
       license. For details, refer to the LICENSE file.
   o README,doc/{ace,options,moreexamples}.tex
     - Notes about bug - see `To Do' above - placed in above files.
       In documentation these are in sections 1.11, 4.4, C.1 (ahead of
       example dated Wed Oct 31 09:41:14 2001)
   o PackageInfo.g,doc/install.tex
     - Max Horn listed as co-maintainer.
     - Now list dependence as requiring GAP version >= 4.7.
   o PackageInfo.g,doc/{{ace,install}.tex,manual.bib},src/al[012].h,
     src/{ace,coinc,control,enum,enum0[012],parser,postproc,util[012]}.c
     - updated email address for Colin Ramsay, and web address for 
       George Havas and ACE 3.001.
   o doc/manual.bib
     - some references now in the main .bib file
   o doc/manual.tex
     - two \def s added to ensure GAP's manualbib.xml.bib (prev. manual.bib)
       is compatible with gapmacro compilation.
   o doc/install.tex
     - changed Reference manual reference to `gap.ini' and `gaprc' files,
       from `.gaprc' file.
     - removed reference to `make_doc', which is not included in
       downloadable archives.
   o doc/{ace,install,options}.tex:
     - added blank line before each \endexample line, to account for
       changed behaviour which was not tabbing the last line of an example
   o PackageInfo.g,README,VERSION,doc/{manual,ace,install}.tex:
     - routine changes
   o tst/aceds.tst
     - Info lines in example only appear when `InfoACELevel' is set to 3.
       This has been wrong for a while. It was wrong in Version 5.0.
       Line `SetInfoACELevel(3)' added. Some additional lines also appear
       at this `InfoACELevel'. These and some further tidy-ups done.
Version 5.1 (2012-01-22)
   Last GAP 4.4 version.
   o make_zoo,pack_pkg:
     - make_zoo is deprecated
     - (newly created) pack_pkg now creates a tar.gz archive
   o configure,Makefile.in:
     - made more robust, to ensure that they work well with both 
       GAP 4.4 and 4.5
   o doc/manual.bib:
     - some typos. fixed
   o doc/make_doc:
     - the current HTML converter etc/convert.pl fails to include /htm
       in the main GAP manual links, since it is attuned for GAP 4.5; 
       a temporary perl command was added to fix this
   o PackageInfo.g,README,VERSION,doc/{manual,ace,install}.tex:
     - routine changes including an update to address and email address
