                   README file for the Gpd package
                   ===============================

Introduction
------------
This package allows for the computation of finite groupoids: both connected, and with several components.  Graphs of groups and graphs of groupoids are also constructed, allowing the calculation of normal forms for Free Products with Amalgamation and for HNN extensions when the initial groups have rewriting systems.

History
-------
Version 1.001 was called GraphGpd, and  formed part of Emma Moore's PhD thesis in December 2000.
Version 1.002 was prepared for the GAP 4.4 release in January 2004, and deposited in the incoming directory on the St Andrews ftp server.
In the spring of 2006 the package was renamed Gpd and extensively rewritten, with documentation in GAPDoc format.
Version 1.01 was deposited in June 2006. 
Gpd became an accepted GAP package in May 2015. 
(In the latest temporary versions there have been a number of changes of function name, such as IsDigraph becoming GpdIsDigraph. 
This is in order to avoid conflicts with the new Digraphs package.
Further changes will be made once the Digraphs package becomes part of the GAP distribution.) 
A more detailed history is included as Chapter 8 of the manual, and in the file CHANGES.

Distribution
------------
The Gpd package is distributed with the accepted GAP packages: see
