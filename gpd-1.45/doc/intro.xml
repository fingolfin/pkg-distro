Groupoids are mathematical categories in which every arrow is invertible. 
The &gpd; package provides functions for the computation with
groupoids and their morphisms; 
for graphs of groups and graphs of groupoids. 
The package is far from complete, and development continues. 
<P/>
It was used by Emma Moore in her thesis <Cite Key="emma-thesis" /> 
to calculate normal forms for <E>free products with amalgamation</E>, 
and for <E>HNN-extensions</E> 
when the initial groups have rewriting systems.
<P/>

The latest version is &GPDVERSION; for &GAP; 4.8, 
released on &GPDLONGRELEASEDATE;, 
and may be more recent than the release on the &GAP; archive. 
<P/> 
The package may be obtained as a compressed tar file 
<File>&GPDTARFILENAME;</File>
by ftp from one of the following sites: 
<List>
<Item>
any &GAP; archive, e.g. 
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/gpd.html</URL>; 
</Item>
<Item>
the package GitHub repository: 
<URL>https://gap-packages.github.io/gpd</URL>. 
</Item>
</List>
<P/>

The information parameter <C>InfoGpd</C> takes default value <C>1</C> 
which, for the benefit of new users, causes more messages 
to be printed out when operations fail.
When raised to a higher value, additional information is printed out. 
<P/>
Help is available in the usual way.

<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage( "gpd" );

</Example>

For version 1.05 the package was completely restructured, 
starting with <E>magmas with objects</E> and their mappings, 
and building up to groupoids via semigroups with objects 
and monoids with objects. 
From version 1.07 the package includes some functions to implement 
constructions contained in <Cite Key="AlWe" />. 
More functions will be released as soon as possible.  
<P/>
Once the package is loaded, it is possible to check the correct 
installation by running the test suite of the package with the command  
<C> ReadPackage( "gpd", "tst/testall.g" ); </C>

You may reference this package by mentioning <Cite Key="BrMoPoWe" />, 
<Cite Key="emma-thesis" /> and <Cite Key="AlWe" />.
