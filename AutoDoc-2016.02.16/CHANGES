This file describes changes in the AutoDoc package.

2016-01-21:
  - The AutoDoc() function now accepts IsDirectory() objects
    as first argument, and you can omit the first argument
    (it then defaults to the current directory).
    Packages using AutoDoc may want to adapt their makedoc.g
    to use this new facility for improved robustness.
